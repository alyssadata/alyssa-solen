# Engagement  
This is a public-safe engagement guide.   

## Minimum requirements  
I start with a bounded baseline only.  

Send this minimum packet:  
- System type (chatbot | RAG | agent)  
- Access (staging link OR 30–50 transcripts)  
- Rules/constraints (what must always hold)  
- If doc-based: the doc set or a small export  
- Fix owner (who applies changes)  

If any of the above is missing, I cannot run a fix-oriented loop.  

## First step deliverable  
First step is always the same:  
- 10 to 20 test cases  
- failure labels  
- one patch recommendation  
- retest plan  
 
## What you receive  
- Repro cases and evidence  
- Failure map and severity  
- Patch pack (prompt, retrieval, gating)  
- Retest proof on the same cases  
- Regression set for updates  

## Smallest request from me  
Thank you for reaching out. To understand whether I can help, please email me:  

1) System type (chatbot | RAG | agent)  
2) Access (staging link OR 30–50 transcripts)  
3) Rules/constraints (what must always hold)  
4) If doc-based: the doc set or a small export  
5) Who applies fixes on your side  

If you send that packet, I can tell you the smallest bounded next step.
