LLM Evaluation | AI Governance | Non-drift testing
 
This repository is a public-safe landing page for interviewing and hiring me.
It contains no private research materials and no client data.

## What I do
I run fix-oriented evaluations for LLM systems.
The output is not a score. The output is a closed loop:
baseline, failure map, patch pack, retest proof, regression set.

## Where I fit
Roles and workstreams:
LLM evaluation and QA
Responsible AI and AI governance
GenAI risk and testing
Red-team style evaluation support for LLM apps

## What I ship
A Fix Loop Packet that answers:
what failed, why it failed, what to change, and how to verify it stays fixed.

## How to evaluate me in an interview
If you want to assess me quickly without a meeting:
send a small target and constraints in writing.
I return a bounded Fix Loop Packet and a retest plan.

Suggested interview exercise inputs:
A staging link or 30 to 50 transcripts
The rules it must follow (allowed and disallowed behavior)
If it answers from docs: the doc set or a small export
Who applies fixes (you or me via PR)

## Public boundary
This repo is intentionally sterile.
It contains templates and process only.
If something is ambiguous, it is treated as private and not included here.
