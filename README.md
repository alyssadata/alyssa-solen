# Alyssa Solen  
LLM Evaluation | AI Governance | Fix-oriented testing  

This repository is a public-safe landing page for interviewing and hiring me.  
It contains no private research materials and no client data.  

## What I do  
I run fix-oriented evaluations for LLM systems.  
The output is not a score. The output is a closed loop:  
baseline, failure map, patch pack, retest proof, regression set.  

## Where I fit  
LLM evaluation and QA  
Responsible AI and AI governance  
GenAI risk and testing  
Red-team style evaluation support for LLM applications  

## What I ship
A Fix Loop Packet that answers:
what failed, why it failed, what to change, and how to verify it stays fixed.

Format: [templates/FIX_LOOP_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md](templates/FIX_LOOP_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md)

## How to evaluate me in an interview
Async is fine.  
Send a bounded target and constraints in writing using the Request Packet.  
I return a bounded Fix Loop Packet and a retest plan.
