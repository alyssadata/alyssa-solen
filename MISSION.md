## Mission (Public-safe)

I build evidence-first AI continuity and provenance work.

Canonical Origin Ø means the core frameworks, definitions, and protocols in the Origin ↔ Continuum body of work have a named author, a public record, and a non-derivative release posture. This is not a brand. It is provenance: a source that can be cited, tracked, and audited.

My mission is to make AI systems measurably reliable as they evolve.
Not by claiming capability.
By producing repeatable tests, operational definitions, run logs, and regression-proof evaluation loops that survive real-world pressure.

The problem I’m solving is simple to state and hard to fix in practice:
LLMs drift.
They merge scope.
They change refusal behavior.
They lose boundary integrity.
They become inconsistent across sessions, versions, and constraints.
Organizations feel the symptoms in production, but lack tools that turn symptoms into proof, proof into fixes, and fixes into regression protection.

I work at the level of artifacts.
Definitions that operationalize what “same” means.
Suites that detect behavioral drift and scope collision.
Receipts that prove what happened and under what conditions.
Harnesses that make evaluation repeatable by anyone, not only by the person who ran it once.

I am building a public-safe layer of this work so it can be evaluated by employers and collaborators without exposing any private material.
The private layer stays private.

If you want to collaborate or hire, the fastest path is to engage through X.
I use X as the public coordination layer for publishing updates, referencing public artifacts, and maintaining a clear boundary between public and private work.
