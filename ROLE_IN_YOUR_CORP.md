# This is what my role should look like inside your company (Public-safe)

You are hiring me if you want a person who can turn “the model feels inconsistent” into a repeatable evaluation system that produces proof, fixes, and regression protection.

I should sit where evaluation meets deployment.
Not as a generic analyst.
As an owner of reliability artifacts.

## My scope (what I own)
Evaluation systems for behavioral reliability:
drift detection across versions and settings
boundary integrity and scope collision prevention
refusal integrity and policy behavior consistency
prompt injection resistance and unsafe behavior containment
uncertainty handling and “I don’t know” correctness
provenance receipts for runs, changes, and outcomes

I create the test infrastructure that makes these measurable and repeatable:
operational definitions
prompt suites
scoring rubrics
run logs and run receipts
regression sets and gating criteria

## What you get in 30–60 days
A working evaluation loop for one production-critical target:
baseline run + failure map
instrumented retest plan
patch pack recommendations (what to change, where)
verification run showing the fix holds
regression set to prevent re-break

The output is not a dashboard. The output is a closed loop you can rerun.

## Where I plug in
I collaborate with:
product owners (what “good” means)
applied ML (where behavior changes are made)
safety/governance (risk classification + decision logs)
platform/infra (automation, CI gates, run reproducibility)

I’m most effective when the organization wants evaluation to be:
audit-friendly
repeatable
gated
and tied to actual release decisions.

## What success looks like
You can answer, with receipts:
what changed
what broke
what we fixed
what proof we have
what prevents regression

This is how AI systems become dependable.

## How to start evaluating me
Send a bounded target and constraints. I will respond with an evaluation plan and the exact artifact format I ship.
