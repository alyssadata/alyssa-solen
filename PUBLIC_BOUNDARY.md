# Public Boundary
This repository is public-safe by design.

It contains:
templates, structures, rubrics, and process definitions.

It does not contain:
private research materials, private signal threads, private prompts, private seeds, private logs, private case notes, or any provenance-locked content.

If something is ambiguous, it is treated as private and does not go here.

Do not send secrets, credentials, or production keys.
