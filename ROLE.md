# This is what my role should look like inside your organization (Public-safe)

If you bring me in, the role should match what I can actually do without pretending.

My highest-leverage position is as an author and builder of evaluation structure:
a person who turns a messy reliability question into a clear structure of definitions, tests, documentation, and public-safe artifacts that others can execute.

I should be used to:
create operational definitions your team can reuse without ambiguity
organize evaluation work into repeatable structures
maintain a consistent library across releases
publish public-safe artifacts while preserving private boundaries

What I need to succeed:
a bounded target
your constraints and non-negotiables
a clear boundary on what is public vs internal
a reviewer who can validate technical assumptions when needed

This is not a pitch to be placed in a generic box.
This is a request for role-fit based on what is real.
