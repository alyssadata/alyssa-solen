# If you don’t hire me, this is what I’m building anyway (Public-safe)

I am building an evidence-first continuity and provenance library for AI evaluation and governance.

This work does not depend on a job title.
It depends on shipping artifacts that can be run, cited, and reused.

## What I will keep shipping publicly
Operational definitions (public-safe)
Evaluation harnesses and run-ready templates
Bench suites that measure drift and boundary integrity
Regression sets and gating patterns
Provenance receipts for repeatable evaluation runs
Public-safe documentation for how to use the artifacts

## What I will keep private
Any sealed materials, private research notes, private keys, and any content that is not explicitly approved for public release.

## Why this matters to industry
AI systems are being deployed faster than reliability methods are being standardized.
Organizations need repeatable ways to detect drift, prevent scope merge, and prove what changed.
This is a missing layer between “model performance” and “deployment safety.”

## How to collaborate (public-safe)
I coordinate publicly on X for:
release notes
artifact pointers
calls for bounded evaluation targets
collaboration requests that remain within public-safe boundaries

If your org wants to collaborate, the fastest way is:
send a bounded target + constraints
agree on a public-safe output scope
ship a run + receipt + regression set
